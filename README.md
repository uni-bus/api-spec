# Uni Bus API Endpoints

This repository documents the API used in the [Uni Bus iOS](https://github.com/uni-bus/ios) and [Uni Bus Android](https://github.com/uni-bus/android) apps.

## Use of this API

You're more than welcome to use our hosted Uni Bus API to build an integration for an existing university - however [please reach out to us first](mailto:unibus@ibuildstuff.co.uk). We're also happy to add additional universities to the Uni Bus API - again [please reach out to us](mailto:unibus@ibuildstuff.co.uk) and we can discuss this.

Whilst we don't currently apply any rate limits - we reserve the right to in the future - and to reject connections from unruly apps.
